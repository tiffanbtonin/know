# I Read Major Exchanges' Terms of Service So You Donâ€™t Have To  
**A Detailed Look at Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, OKX, Crypto.com, MEXC, Gate.io, Huobi, Nexo, Bybit, Mt. Gox, and FTX**

Understanding the fine print of crypto exchanges' Terms of Service (ToS) is essential for any trader or investor. After a judge ruled that assets on Celsius didnâ€™t belong to users, I decided to dive deep into the ToS of major exchanges to uncover whether users truly "own" their assets and if any insurance protections exist. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive analysis of how your assets might be treated in the event of bankruptcy or other mishaps.

## TL;DR Summary

- **Ownership**: Kraken and Coinbase explicitly recognize that assets belong to users, while Binance, OKX, and other exchanges either fail to mention this or reserve rights that can harm users.  
- **Insurance**: Coinbase provides partial insurance for user funds in fiat (up to $250,000) and additional coverage with its subscription plan, Coinbase One. Crypto.com offers limited insurance against unauthorized transactions. Other exchanges (e.g., OKX, Bybit, Gate.io, MEXC) offer no user protection in cases of insolvency.  
- **Risks**: Always assume that exchanges can change their ToS at any time, leaving your funds unprotected. Store funds in cold wallets for long-term safety.

## Terms of Service Analysis by Exchange  

### 1. **Binance**  
- **Ownership**: No explicit mention of user ownership or asset insurance.  
- **Insurance**: None provided.  
- **Key Takeaway**: Binance states that they assume no liability for service accuracy or reliability. They reserve the right to deny responsibility for any losses incurred during platform use.

---

### 2. **Kraken**  
- **Ownership**: Kraken clearly states that user assets belong to the users.  
- **Insurance**: No insurance for user funds or losses due to hacks or platform issues.  
- **Concerns**: If the exchange suffers a significant loss (e.g., hack), legal battles could leave users empty-handed.  
- **Key Takeaway**: While Kraken ensures ownership, users are unprotected in insolvency cases.

---

### 3. **Coinbase**  
- **Ownership**: Explicitly states that assets belong to users.  
- **Insurance**:  
  - Up to **$250,000** coverage for fiat held in user wallets.  
  - **$1M insurance** for fiat and crypto with a Coinbase One subscription.  
  - Limited insurance for theft but unclear on exact coverage percentages.  
- **Key Takeaway**: Coinbase offers the best insurance coverage among major exchanges, but terms vary by asset type.

---

### 4. **OKX**  
- **Ownership**: User funds may be registered under OKXâ€™s name or a custodianâ€™s. In insolvency cases, users may have no claim.  
- **Insurance**: None offered.  
- **Risk Disclosure**:  
  - Assets pooled with others may result in shared losses during shortfalls.  
  - In bankruptcy, OKX states users are treated as unsecured creditors.  
- **Key Takeaway**: **Exercise extreme caution with OKX.** Assets registered under OKXâ€™s name are at significant risk in cases of default.

---

### 5. **Crypto.com**  
- **Ownership**: No explicit acknowledgment.  
- **Insurance**:  
  - Coverage up to **$250,000** for unauthorized transactions.  
  - Crypto.com reserves the right to determine whether a transaction was unauthorized.  
- **Key Takeaway**: Users may not recover funds in bankruptcy cases or during prolonged service disruptions.

---

### 6. **MEXC**  
- **Ownership**: No mention of ownership or insurance in its one-page ToS.  
- **Liability**: Protects itself from nearly all responsibilities, including losses due to negligence.  
- **Key Takeaway**: Users assume all risks, with zero recourse in disputes or financial loss.

---

### 7. **Gate.io**  
- **Ownership**: No explicit mention.  
- **Risk**: Unclaimed accounts are deemed abandoned after two years, forfeiting all funds to Gate.io.  
- **Liability**: Limits user claims for losses to three months of service costs. Users breaching terms may owe **$2 million in damages**.  
- **Key Takeaway**: Terms heavily favor Gate.io, with little user protection in asset ownership or insurance.

---

### 8. **Huobi**  
- **Ownership**: No acknowledgment of user ownership or insurance.  
- **Liability**: States no responsibility for service disruptions or insolvency-related losses.  
- **Key Takeaway**: Users have no protections in the event of bankruptcy or platform failure.

---

### 9. **Bybit**  
- **Ownership**: No recognition of user ownership rights.  
- **Insurance**:  
  - Offers "insurance funds" for extreme market conditions, but this is intended for company protection, not users.  
- **Key Takeaway**: Bybit retains full custody of assets and can freeze accounts without notice for suspected breaches of ToS.

---

### 10. **Nexo**  
- **Ownership**: No explicit mention of asset ownership.  
- **Insurance**: None provided.  
- **Key Takeaway**: Users must settle all debts before withdrawing funds, with potential for withheld funds in cases of suspected fraud.

---

### 11. **FTX (Historical)**  
- **Ownership**: Acknowledged user ownership in its ToS, though this was contradicted in practice.  
- **Insurance**: None provided.  
- **Key Takeaway**: FTX failed to honor its terms, using user funds improperly. Legal acknowledgment of ownership allowed creditors to reclaim partial funds post-collapse.

---

### 12. **Mt. Gox (Historical)**  
- **Ownership**: No formal ToS existed.  
- **Key Takeaway**: The collapse of Mt. Gox left users waiting nearly a decade for fund recovery, with limited or no reimbursements.

---

## Key Insights

- **Coinbase Leads in User Protection**: With ownership acknowledgment and partial insurance, Coinbase is the most user-friendly in terms of ToS.  
- **OKX and Binance Pose Higher Risks**: Both fail to guarantee user ownership or insurance, exposing users to significant risks in insolvency.  
- **Donâ€™t Leave Funds on Exchanges**: The lack of ownership acknowledgment or insurance by most exchanges highlights the importance of moving funds to cold wallets for long-term storage.  

---

## Conclusion: Protect Your Assets

While some exchanges provide limited protection, most ToS are designed to shield companies, not users. To minimize risks:  

1. **Use exchanges for transactions only**â€”donâ€™t store assets long-term.  
2. **Invest in a cold wallet** for secure, offline storage.  
3. Monitor exchange ToS regularly for updates that may impact your funds.
