# Beginner's Guide: What is Cryptocurrency?

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is essentially a decentralized database that operates without the need for third-party intermediaries. Instead, it uses distributed nodes to store, verify, transmit, and share data across the network. Blockchains can be classified into three types based on their level of openness: **public chains**, **private chains**, and **consortium chains**. Among these, public chains are the most open in practical applications.

Public chains allow unrestricted participation, meaning that anyone can join or leave at any time. All data on public chains is transparent and accessible, and anyone can participate in the consensus process. Public chains are considered decentralized and free from institutional control. Bitcoin is a prime example of a public chain, where the system is open to everyone, allowing anyone to become a node, validator, or user. The information on the Bitcoin network is entirely transparent.

## What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency refers to digital assets that use cryptographic technology to ensure security and control the creation and transfer of these assets. Unlike traditional currencies issued and managed by central institutions like banks, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized ledger technologies, such as blockchain. This decentralized nature means that no single entity has control over the network.

## The Relationship Between Blockchain and Cryptocurrency

The relationship between blockchain and cryptocurrency can be summarized in two key points:
1. **Blockchain is the underlying technology** that powers cryptocurrencies.
2. **Cryptocurrency is an application** of blockchain technology.

## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the most representative cryptocurrency. It was introduced in a whitepaper published on October 31, 2008, by an individual or group under the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto." It was launched in 2009 as an open-source project.

Bitcoin operates as a **peer-to-peer (P2P)** decentralized digital currency, meaning that it is a payment system without central control. Transactions are verified and recorded on a decentralized ledger called the blockchain.

Bitcoin is not issued by any institution or individual but is created through a process called "mining," which uses computational power to solve complex problems. Its supply is limited to **21 million coins**, with over 18.69 million already mined. It is projected that the last Bitcoin will be mined by 2140.

## Other Cryptocurrencies

Apart from Bitcoin, numerous other cryptocurrencies exist, each with unique functions and use cases. For example:
- **Ethereum (ETH)**: Known for its "smart contracts," Ethereum powers decentralized applications (dApps) and is considered the second most prominent cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.
- **Stablecoins**: These are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like fiat currencies (e.g., USD) to reduce price volatility. They serve as the foundational currency for trading in the crypto market.
- **Mainstream Cryptocurrencies**: These include assets widely recognized for their strong market consensus, real-world utility, and liquidity.
- **Other Token Categories**: Examples include **Layer 1**, **Layer 2**, **MEME**, and **DeFi** tokens. You can explore various token categories on the [OKX Marketplace](https://bit.ly/OKXe).

## Characteristics of Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies typically exhibit the following features:
1. **Decentralization**: No central authority controls the network.
2. **Anonymity**: Users can transact without revealing their identities.
3. **Transparency**: All transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain.
4. **Immutability**: Transactions cannot be altered once they are recorded.

### Investment Risks

It's important to note that cryptocurrency trading involves risks, including high volatility and potential fraud. Price swings can occur within short periods, and there may be regulatory uncertainties in some jurisdictions. 

For beginners, itâ€™s essential to carefully assess these risks, set clear trading goals, and implement risk management strategies before investing in cryptocurrencies.
