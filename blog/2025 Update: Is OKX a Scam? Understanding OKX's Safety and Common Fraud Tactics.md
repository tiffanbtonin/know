## Is OKX a Scam?

The short answer is no. OKX is **not a scam**, but its name has been misused by fraudsters in various scams. Founded in 2017, OKX is one of the top three cryptocurrency exchanges globally, with over 50 million users across 180+ countries. It offers high liquidity and a solid reputation, as highlighted on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/).

OKX was founded by Star Xu, a prominent blockchain advocate, who has published several books on the subject. Initially operating as OKCoin, the platform shifted its focus to international markets after cryptocurrency restrictions in China. In 2022, OKEx rebranded to OKX to reflect its broader role as a Web3 ecosystem provider.

## OKX‚Äôs Security and Reputation

- OKX has been operating for **over seven years**, surviving multiple bear markets, which demonstrates its resilience.
- The platform separates user funds into **cold and hot wallets** to enhance security, using multi-signature protection to prevent unauthorized access.
- OKX commits to monthly **proof-of-reserves reports**, ensuring 1:1 backing of user assets. You can verify reserves through the [OKX Proof-of-Reserves Page](https://www.okx.com/proof-of-reserves).

### Recent Security Milestones

## Common OKX-Related Fraud Tactics

While OKX itself is secure, scammers often misuse its name to deceive users. Here are the most common tactics and how to protect yourself:

### 1. Romance Scams
Fraudsters on dating apps (e.g., Tinder) build trust over time, then introduce investment opportunities using OKX. They convince victims to transfer funds to an OKX account or other platforms they control, making it impossible to retrieve the money.

**How to Protect Yourself**:
- Be skeptical if someone online discusses investments or offers ‚Äúguaranteed profits.‚Äù
- Never hand over control of your wallet or funds to anyone.

### 2. Fake Websites and Apps
Scammers create fake OKX websites or apps that look legitimate to steal user credentials or funds.

**How to Avoid Fake Websites/Apps**:
- Always access OKX through its official site: [https://www.okx.com](https://www.okx.com).  
- Avoid downloading apps from unofficial sources. Verify the developer's credentials before installation.

### 3. Fake Investment Platforms
Some scammers use OKX as a legitimate gateway before steering victims toward fraudulent platforms. Victims are encouraged to transfer funds from OKX to these fake platforms, often promising high returns.

**How to Identify Fake Platforms**:
- If asked to move funds to a non-reputable platform, stop immediately.  
- Be cautious of platforms promoting exclusive ‚Äúhigh-return‚Äù opportunities.

## What to Do If You Encounter a Scam?

If you suspect fraudulent activity, take the following steps:

### 1. Stop Depositing Funds
Scammers often create a false sense of urgency, claiming funds will be frozen or lost without immediate action. Resist these pressures.

### 2. Collect Evidence
Save screenshots of conversations, transactions, and relevant details. These will be critical when reporting the scam.

### 3. Report the Scam
- File a report with your local authorities and provide all evidence.
- Contact OKX customer support to report the incident. They may assist in freezing fraudulent accounts or tracing funds.

## Why Proof of Reserves is Crucial

OKX‚Äôs proof-of-reserves initiative ensures that user assets are fully backed at a 1:1 ratio. This transparency helps prevent mismanagement of funds, which caused the downfall of other exchanges like FTX. Users can verify their holdings on-chain via tools like [Defillama‚Äôs Transparency Page](https://defillama.com/cex/okx).

## Conclusion: Is OKX Safe?

Yes, OKX is a reliable and secure exchange with industry-leading measures in place to protect user funds. However, vigilance is required to avoid scams. Always double-check URLs, avoid unsolicited investment advice, and ensure you‚Äôre only interacting with verified OKX channels.
