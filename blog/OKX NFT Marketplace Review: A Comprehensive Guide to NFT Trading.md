## OKX NFT Marketplace Overview

The OKX NFT Marketplace offers a robust platform supporting multiple blockchains. Unlike many centralized exchanges that only support Ethereum or Solana, OKX expands its reach to include **Polygon, Aptos, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, Klaytn, Immutable X**, and its own **OKC chain**. The inclusion of multiple blockchains ensures accessibility and affordability for a wide range of users.

Additionally, OKX enhances liquidity by aggregating orders from leading platforms such as **OpenSea, LooksRare, Magic Eden, and Immutable X (IMX)**. This strategy ensures users have access to a rich pool of NFTs for trading.

### Key Features of the OKX NFT Marketplace

The platform is organized into five distinct sections, making navigation intuitive and efficient:

1. **Football Cup**
2. **Featured**
3. **Marketplace**
4. **Launchpad**
5. **Stats**

## Football Cup: Engaging Sports Fans with NFTs

The **Football Cup** section was introduced during the World Cup and exemplifies how NFTs can be used to engage fans. Users were able to mint NFTs representing their favorite teams and stake ETH as part of a prize pool. This gamified approach to NFTs added an interactive element to sports fandom while introducing non-crypto users to the world of NFTs.

**Key Mechanics:**
- Mint up to three team NFTs for free, staking 0.01 ETH per NFT.
- OKX contributes $10 USDT per NFT to the prize pool.
- Prize distribution depends on team performance, with winning team NFT holders sharing the rewards.

This innovative use of NFTs could easily be replicated for future sporting events, bridging the gap between sports fans and crypto enthusiasts.
