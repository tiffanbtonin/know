## 1. Spot Mode

### Overview
In Spot Mode, users can simultaneously hold spot and simplified options within a single account. This mode is limited to spot trading and simple options contracts, excluding leverage or derivatives such as perpetual contracts.

This mode prioritizes safety and simplicity, making it ideal for beginners unfamiliar with high-leverage or complex derivatives trading. Users are automatically activated in Spot Mode upon first use.

### Target Audience
Spot Mode is tailored for beginner traders seeking a safe and controlled trading environment. This mode excludes leveraged trades, reducing risk for newcomers. For example, investors can hold spot positions while buying put options for hedging. In rising markets, spot prices generate profits, while in falling markets, put options offset losses, keeping overall risks manageable.

## 2. Spot and Derivatives Mode

### Overview
The Spot and Derivatives Mode supports spot trading, leverage, futures, perpetual, and options contracts, with options for isolated and cross-margin modes. This mode simplifies trading steps and improves capital efficiency by allowing shared margins and offsetting profits and losses between positions.

For example, if you trade BTC perpetual contracts and BTC/USDT leverage in cross-margin mode, both positions share the same margin and offset each otherâ€™s profits and losses. This greatly enhances margin utilization.

Under cross-margin mode:
- A margin rate â‰¤ 300% triggers a risk alert.
- A margin rate â‰¤ 100% results in automatic position liquidation.

In isolated margin mode, positions and margins remain independent.

### Target Audience
This mode is ideal for experienced retail and quantitative traders. Users can activate it under "Trading Settings" â†’ "Account Mode" â†’ "Spot and Derivatives Mode."

## 3. Multi-Currency Margin Mode

### Overview
The Multi-Currency Margin Mode supports cross-currency trading, where all assets in an account are combined to calculate margin. Unlike Spot and Derivatives Mode, all digital assets in the account are valued in USD and used as shared collateral.

For example, if your account holds BTC, ETH, and LTC, their combined value in USD serves as the margin for BTC perpetual contracts and ETH futures. Profits and losses from these trades offset each other, further improving capital utilization.

This mode eliminates barriers between different cryptocurrencies, enhancing efficiency and allowing seamless cross-market hedging.

### Target Audience
This mode is suited for professional traders, institutions, and API users with strong risk management skills. Activation requires an account equity of at least $10,000, achieved via fund transfers, crypto purchases, or deposits.

## 4. Portfolio Margin Mode

### Overview
Portfolio Margin Mode enables users to trade spot, leverage, perpetual, futures, and options within a single account. It employs risk models to calculate margin requirements based on portfolio positions, significantly reducing overall margin needs while maximizing capital efficiency.

Like Multi-Currency Margin Mode, this mode values all assets in USD for margin calculation. Users can create complex hedging strategies across derivatives and spot positions, further optimizing capital utilization.

For instance:
- Users with large, well-hedged positions benefit from lower margin requirements.
- Profits and losses across various instruments offset each other, reducing risk exposure.

### Target Audience
This mode is best suited for advanced professional traders, institutions, and API users with strong risk management capabilities. Activation requires an account equity of $10,000 and a completed eligibility quiz.
