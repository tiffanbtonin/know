## How Does Tether Work?

Initially built on Bitcoin's **Omni Layer**, Tether has since expanded to support over ten blockchains, including newer networks such as [Avalanche (AVAX)](https://www.okx.com/price/avalanche-avax) and [Polygon (MATIC)](https://www.okx.com/price/polygon-matic). Key aspects of its operation include:

- **Minting and Burning**: Tether Limited can issue (mint) or destroy (burn) USDT tokens depending on market demand. For every new USDT minted, an equivalent amount of USD is added to Tether's reserves.
- **Blockchain Transfers**: USDT can be transferred quickly and cheaply across any supporting blockchain, making it ideal for global transactions.

## What is Tether Used For?

USDT is widely used in crypto trading due to its stability and compatibility with [Web3 wallets](https://www.okx.com/web3) and major crypto exchanges. Key use cases include:

- **Stable Trading Pair**: USDT provides a stable trading pair for cryptocurrencies, reducing exposure to market volatility.
- **Access to US Dollar Value**: It offers a digital alternative to traditional USD, especially in regions with limited access to fiat currencies.
- **Cross-Border Payments**: Tether facilitates efficient, low-cost international transactions.

Tether Limited also publishes daily reports on its reserves and undergoes quarterly assurance opinions by external accountants to ensure transparency.
