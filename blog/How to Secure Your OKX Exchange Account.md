## What Are You Securing Your Account From?

Cryptocurrency offers fast, global transactions, but these are final and cannot be reversed. If crypto assets are stolen, recovery is nearly impossible, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals. Hereâ€™s what you need to watch out for:

### Phishing Attacks
Phishing is one of the most common threats. Attackers may send fake emails, SMS messages, or links pretending to be OKX to steal your credentials. These messages often use panic-inducing tactics, like claiming suspected money laundering or account restrictions.

#### Example
Attackers may send a message such as:  
*"Your account is under review for suspicious activity. Visit [fake link] to verify your identity immediately."*  

### How to Avoid Phishing Scams:
1. **Verify Communications**: Use the [Channel Verification Tool](https://www.okx.com/support-center/channel-verification) to confirm email, SMS, or URLs.
2. **Log in Safely**: Always use [OKXâ€™s official website](https://www.okx.com) or app for login.
3. **Contact Support**: If you receive suspicious messages, report them to [OKX Support](https://www.okx.com/help).
